5.0 out of 5 stars,"Well, it’s 2020 MacBook expectations should be met, it’s powerful... quite comfortable to hold .. I Just blindly went for it because of 256gb storage + HDFC 7k discount. It’s low priced compere to 2019 model with better improvement like Esc Key, magic keyboarder.",Navaneet,Reviewed in India on 20 June 2020,As Expected,148 people found this helpful
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Hi guys,I have upgraded from Macbook Air 2017 to Macbook pro-2020 13"" 256GB variant. The main reason for my upgrade was for studies, coding, editing, and entertainment. I wanted to give the air to my mom for light usage as I had already used it for 2 years now and with mild usage, it would run 2 more years without any issues. Hence, I finally upgraded, and here is my detailed review of the product after 2 days of usage :I would start by saying that I am extremely delighted with the new Mac. The new magic keyboard is better than the one on the air. The body is beautiful and the look and design are elite. The space grey looks stunning and the size of the laptop is nice and convenient for typing and using it any place as per your comfort. The speed is really good for an 8GB RAM Mac and I have been trying out some light to moderate photo and video editing, it has been flawless with no rendering issues. I highly recommend keeping an HDD available to store files that you do not require always on your Mac and keep the essential files only for optimum performance. The display on this Mac is amazing, the pictures clicked on my iPhone look beautiful. The web browsing experience has been really good. Moderate level games run fine like Asphalt 8 or 9 even at top quality graphics. Overall, the experience has been fantastic and I am glad I upgraded to the Mac pro so soon and didn't wait for Apple Silicon.This Mac is ideal for any student, average coder, professional work, or any relevant field where you need a powerful device and a compact, easy to carry machine. This doesn't have a dedicated GPU but I don't feel the need for it. The device in itself with all the features is a monster and can smoothly carry out all your daily operations. You can blindly go for this one and I am sure you won't be disappointed at all. In accessories, I would suggest either a USB C dock or 2 converters to USB 3.0, a keyboard protector, and a good laptop sleeve or bag. This would easily last 4 years as per my understanding. Apple does a great job in terms of longevity, performance, optimization, and simplicity. If you have other Apple products, this would add value to your ecosystem too.Thanks for reading through, I hope you guys enjoyed and found this helpful.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"The Touch Bar stopped working on day 3 and software got corrupted. The machine went into loop of shutting and restarting if left alone for 3 minutes of more. Multiple error messages were displayed at the start up again.Apple support team tried to fix the issue, but all in vain. Amazon’s technical help also gave up.Returned the laptop. What a shame that 142000/- Rs device provided value of 0/- Rs.",Amazon Customer,Reviewed in India on 16 August 2020,High Price for Low Quality,29 people found this helpful
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Well it’s a super feeling to be a proud owner of this Beast yet Elegant Device. Delivered a day later than promised AMAZON.. Yet I am Happy. I am having Space Grey color which gives a highly professional look.I will write a full detailed Review of all Pros & Cons after a month.However, at first glance and preliminary experience, I have observed following advantages over its competitors (Truly there are none).1.  Extraordinary Wifi capabilities.2.  Very Secured Environment. (feels you are working for FBI, CIA or so)3.  Truly Loud yet very High Quality Speakers. (Late Night Movies on Bed are Back)4.  Touchpad experience is like you never need a External Mouse.5.  Built Quality is Awesome, its well balanced and Light weight.",JUNED,Reviewed in India on 31 July 2020,Highly Recommended!!!

5.0 out of 5 stars,"After using 1 month I'm writing here. I choose Mac Pro Intel i5 version instead of M1 chip & I feel it is wise decision for me according to my requirements. I'm get Pro version in best deal 99k. All though it is 2020 version but still it is powerful machine.I do coding work so this Mac Pro best fit for  me in cheaper price, sometimes I also do video editing Da Vinci resolve 17 run smoothly( I'm do intermediate level of video editing not a pro). This Mac Pro can also editing 4k video, 1 layer is ok but as you increase layers it start lag.It's battery backup is less than M1 chip mac  but still I like this.And also appreciate Appario retail they are highly trust seller & product is delivered at my address in 2 days supperrr fast delivery",Prabal,Reviewed in India on 26 March 2021,Best deal,One person found this helpful
